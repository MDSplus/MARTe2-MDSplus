RABBIT wrapper for Simulink
Works for Matlab 2015a

== Stand alone tests ==
 $ ./matlab_RABBIT.sh # sets up environment for RABBIT and start matlab 2015a
 >> run_RABBIT_tests % run tests

or:
 ./test_RABBIT.sh # start matlab and run tests directly

== To use as part of code suite (SCD, RAPTORsuite) ==
In your matlab startup script, add the following line:
 source set_RABBIT_env.bash # setup RABBIT environment 
Then follow the examples in the /tests folder
